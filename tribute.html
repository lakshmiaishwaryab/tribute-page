                    Helping others, without expecting anything in return is what true self-worth is all about. 
                    Our Power star's self worth can only be measured by god. Besides being an amazing actor, producer and singer he was a compassionate,selfless human being. 
                    His smile could make anyone's day. 
                    From Appu to James young or old every kannadiga is a fan. On 29th October, 2021 the whole of Karnataka 
                    shed tears, hearts shattered into pieces because every house felt the loss of a son, Appu.

                    He rarely spoke about his philanthropic activities.
                    His contribution in fighting Covid 19 was tremendous 
                    he donated Rs 50 lakh and also helped in spreading awareness throughout 2020 and 2021.
                    He donated money to help flood victims of North Karnataka in 2019.
                     He supported 26 orphanages, 16 old age homes and 19 gaushalas. He was also involved in the charitable institution 'Shaktidhama'
                      supporting thousands of girl students. He donated his eyes which further helped in giving vision to 4 other people. He was a role model to many.
                      He also adopted many government schools. All of the above works he was doing came to light only after  his demise.
